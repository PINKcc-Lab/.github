## 🌟 Our Mission
At the **PINKCC Lab**, we bridge the gap between technological innovation and clinical excellence. Based at the **Institut de Recherche en Cancérologie de Montpellier (IRCM)**, our state-of-the-art laboratory leverages Artificial Intelligence to transform how we understand, analyze, and treat cancer.

Our core focus is the development of **"Virtual Cancer Biopsies"**—digitally replicating complex histological and molecular tumor characteristics through non-invasive imaging, reducing the need for painful procedures and enabling truly personalized medicine.

## 🧪 Key Research Areas

### 🖥️ Clinical & Microscopic AI
* **Virtual Biopsies:** Integrating radiomics and pathomics to decode tumor phenotypes.
* **Multi-omics Fusion:** Combining clinical imaging (MRI, CT) with genomic and proteomic data.
* **Biophysical Modeling:** Mapping hypoxia, pH levels, and tissue elasticity using AI-driven predictive models.

### 🧬 Major Projects
- **MR-O-MICS (ERC-funded):** Exploring ovarian cancer heterogeneity using advanced AI.
- **PANC-O-MICS (ARC-funded):** Developing tools for early detection and response evaluation in pancreatic cancer.
- **PINKCC Challenge:** An annual international data science competition focused on oncology imaging.
